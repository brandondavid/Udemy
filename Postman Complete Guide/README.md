# Postman Complete Guide
**Postman: The Complete Guide**  
_In the first part of the course we will start exploring the features of Postman and continue by writing API tests with the intention of integrating them in a CI server where the tests will run on a current basis.  The second part of the course will include user questions and answers to problems that were not yet covered in the course or that are more specific and may not interest everybody._
