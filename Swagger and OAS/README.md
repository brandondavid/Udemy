# Swagger and OAS 
**Learn Swagger and the Open API Specification**  
_The Open API Specification (often called "Swagger") is currently the most popular way to create definitions of RESTful APIs. With these definitions, you can create sophisticated, autogenerated documentation, generate SDKs in several languages, and do automated testing. Swagger is a set of open source tools that use these Open API Specification definition files.  In addition to videos, this course contains 7 hands-on exercises that lead you step-by-step in creating an API definition file, including a final project where you create a file from scratch given sample requests and responses. It also contains a document with resources on learning more about OAS, Swagger, and alternatives._
