# API Documentation 3: The Art of API Documentation
**The Art of API Documentation**  
_This is the third in a series of courses for technical writers who want to learn how to write API documentation. The first two courses are called "Learn API Technical Writing: JSON and XML for Writers" and "Learn API Technical Writing: REST for Writers", and it's recommended that you first take those courses, unless you are very familiar with API documentation, and how to document reference material.  This course teaches how to write conceptual API documentation, such as overviews, getting started sections, and tutorials. In addition to conceptual material, this course covers guidelines for good sample code, tools for making REST requests, and how to find an open source project to document as a way to get into the field of API writing._
